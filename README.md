# Creative Project 2
## Overview:
I created a website to gives somebody ideas for texts. Initially, it was going to be insults and advice or complements. But the insults API turned out to be a pile of garbage and didn't have the right CORS header or something and so I couldn't use it. So I just did some random cat pictures instead they're pretty cool.
## APIs used:
1. RandomCat
	* To generate the random cat pictures
2. Advice Slip
	* To generate random pieces of advice and also to search for them.
## Endpoints Used:
There was one for the random cat pictures API and two for the advice slip one (one for calling random advice and one for searching by a query). I used multiple variables in the searching by a query call because I had to check to see if the number of search results were 0.
